Workflow that integrates a warm-up phase for generic reasoning, dynamic curriculum training, and enhanced evaluation. This step‐by‐step guide outlines how to set up the model, prepare the data, progressively fine-tune with curriculum learning, and finally apply RLHF.

---

## 1. Model Setup

**a. Load the Model in 8‑bit Mode and Attach LoRA Adapters**

- **8‑bit Loading:** Use bitsandbytes to load LLaMA 3.2 3B in 8‑bit mode.
- **LoRA Adapters:** Add LoRA adapters while freezing the base model weights.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from peft import get_peft_model, LoraConfig

# Load base model and tokenizer in 8-bit mode
model_name = "LLaMA-3.2-3B"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    load_in_8bit=True,
    device_map="auto"
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Configure and attach LoRA adapters
lora_config = LoraConfig(
    r=8,
    lora_alpha=16,
    target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj"],  # update modules as needed
    lora_dropout=0.1,
    bias="none",
)
model = get_peft_model(model, lora_config)

# Freeze base model parameters
for param in model.base_model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False
```

---

## 2. Dataset Preparation

**a. Data Sources and Uniform Formatting**

- **Datasets:** GSM8K, AQuA, StrategyQA, plus additional generic reasoning data.
- **Uniform Template:**

  ```plaintext
  {role: system, content: "Generate a step by step reasoning for this question."}
  {role: user, content: "Your question here"}
  {role: assistant, content: "<think> reasoning steps </think> final answer"}
  ```
Including {role: system, content: "Generate a step by step reasoning for this question."} explicitly in your training data is crucial if you want the model to learn when to reason vs when to just answer.

**b. Tokenization**

- Use the same tokenizer as the model.
- Apply padding and truncation as needed.

```python
def tokenize_function(example):
    return tokenizer(example["content"], padding="max_length", truncation=True, max_length=256)

# Assuming a Hugging Face Dataset format:
tokenized_dataset = raw_dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)
```

---

## 3. Warm-Up Phase: Generic Reasoning 

**a. Supervised Fine Tuning:**

**Objective:** Establish a broad foundation in chain-of-thought reasoning before specializing.

- **Dataset:** Use a large, diverse set of generic reasoning examples.
- **Benefits:** Helps the model learn CoT structure, which can later be refined with more specific problems.

```python
# Assume generic_reasoning_dataset is prepared and tokenized
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

warmup_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./warmup_checkpoints",
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,
    num_train_epochs=2,
    learning_rate=5e-5,
    logging_steps=50,
    save_steps=500,
    evaluation_strategy="steps"
)

warmup_trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=warmup_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_generic_reasoning_dataset["train"],
    eval_dataset=tokenized_generic_reasoning_dataset["validation"],
)
warmup_trainer.train()

# Save warm-up checkpoint for later curriculum training stages
model.save_pretrained("./warmup_checkpoint")
```
**b. Self-Consistency Decoding:**

At inference, perform multiple sampling runs and aggregate outputs to boost final answer accuracy.
def self_consistency_decode(query, num_samples=10):
    generated_answers = []
    input_ids = tokenizer(query, return_tensors="pt").input_ids.to(model.device)
    for _ in range(num_samples):
        output = model.generate(
            input_ids,
            max_length=128,
            do_sample=True,
            top_k=50,
            top_p=0.95,
        )
        generated_answers.append(tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
    # Aggregate answers (e.g., via majority vote) and return the most frequent answer.
    return max(set(generated_answers), key=generated_answers.count)

# Example usage:
query = "Your formatted input query here..."
final_answer = self_consistency_decode(query)
print("Final answer:", final_answer)

---

## 4. Curriculum Learning

**Strategy:** Progressively fine-tune the model with increasing difficulty while maintaining elements of generic reasoning throughout training.

### **Stage Definition**

| **Stage** | **Dataset**                                                         | **Complexity**                     |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **1**     | Warm-Up (Generic Reasoning)                                         | Basic chain-of-thought reasoning   |
| **2**     | GSM8K (Simple arithmetic)                                           | Single-step reasoning              |
| **3**     | GSM8K (Medium) + AQuA (Multi-step arithmetic)                       | Intermediate multi-step reasoning  |
| **4**     | GSM8K + AQuA + StrategyQA + Additional Generic Reasoning Mix         | Complex reasoning and diversity    |

### **a. Progressive Training Loop**

- **Dynamic Curriculum:** Monitor performance; consider mixing batches from previous stages to reinforce fundamentals.
- **Checkpointing:** Save the model after each stage.

```python
curriculum_datasets = [dataset_stage1, dataset_stage2, dataset_stage3, dataset_stage4]

# Start from the warm-up checkpoint
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("./warmup_checkpoint")
model = get_peft_model(model, lora_config)  # reattach LoRA if needed

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./curriculum_checkpoints",
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    learning_rate=5e-5,
    logging_steps=50,
    save_steps=500,
    evaluation_strategy="steps"
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
)

for stage, dataset in enumerate(curriculum_datasets, start=1):
    print(f"Starting Curriculum Stage {stage}")
    
    # Tokenize dataset if not already tokenized
    tokenized_stage_dataset = dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)
    trainer.train_dataset = tokenized_stage_dataset["train"]
    trainer.eval_dataset = tokenized_stage_dataset["validation"]
    
    trainer.train()
    
    # Save checkpoint for this stage
    checkpoint_path = f"./curriculum_stage_{stage}"
    model.save_pretrained(checkpoint_path)
    print(f"Checkpoint saved to {checkpoint_path}")
```

---

## 5. Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLHF)

**a. Setup RLHF with PPO**

- **Load Last Checkpoint:** Use the final curriculum stage checkpoint.
- **Value Head:** Wrap the model with a value head for PPO.
- **Reward Function:** Refine reward signals; consider nuanced rewards (partial credit, etc.) for improved stability.

```python
from trl import PPOTrainer, PPOConfig, AutoModelForCausalLMWithValueHead

MODEL_NAME = "./curriculum_stage_4"
model_with_vhead = AutoModelForCausalLMWithValueHead.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME, trust_remote_code=True)

ppo_config = PPOConfig(model_name=MODEL_NAME, learning_rate=1e-5)
ppo_trainer = PPOTrainer(config=ppo_config, model=model_with_vhead, tokenizer=tokenizer)
```

**b. Define an Enhanced Reward Function**

- Adjust rewards based on answer quality, not just binary correctness.

```python
def reward_function(samples, references):
    rewards = []
    for sample, ref in zip(samples, references):
        try:
            # Extract final answer after the <think> block
            answer_str = sample.split("</think>")[-1].strip()
            correct_answer = ref.split("</think>")[-1].strip()
            reward = 1.0 if answer_str == correct_answer else -0.5  # partial penalty for close but incorrect answers
        except Exception:
            reward = -1.0
        rewards.append(reward)
    return rewards
```

**c. PPO Training Loop**

```python
def run_ppo_training(num_ppo_steps=20):
    for step in range(num_ppo_steps):
        # Sample a small batch from the most complex curriculum stage
        batch = curriculum_datasets[-1].shuffle().select(range(4))
        queries = [tokenizer.decode(ids, skip_special_tokens=True) for ids in batch["input_ids"]]

        responses = []
        for query in queries:
            response = ppo_trainer.model.generate(
                tokenizer(query, return_tensors="pt").input_ids.to(ppo_trainer.model.device),
                max_length=128,
                do_sample=True,
                top_k=50,
                top_p=0.95,
            )
            responses.append(tokenizer.decode(response[0], skip_special_tokens=True))

        rewards = reward_function(responses, queries)
        stats = ppo_trainer.step(queries, responses, rewards)
        print(f"Step {step} - PPO stats: {stats}")

run_ppo_training(num_ppo_steps=20)

# Save the final RLHF-tuned model
model_with_vhead.save_pretrained("./rlhf_llama3.2_3b")
```

---

## 6. Evaluation & Checkpointing

- **Regular Evaluations:** Use a held-out validation set (or composite set) after each stage and PPO step.
- **Self-Consistency:** At inference time, sample multiple outputs to perform majority voting or aggregation for more accurate final answers.
- **Dynamic Adjustments:** Based on evaluation results, consider revisiting earlier stages or adjusting curriculum pacing.

---

## Summary

1. **Model Setup:** Load LLaMA 3.2 3B in 8‑bit mode with LoRA adapters and freeze the base model.
2. **Data Preparation:** Format datasets uniformly using `<think> </think>` tokens and tokenize consistently.
3. **Warm-Up Phase:** Begin training with generic reasoning examples to build a strong chain-of-thought foundation.
4. **Curriculum Learning:** Progress through increasingly complex stages (from GSM8K’s simple arithmetic to a mix of GSM8K, AQuA, StrategyQA, and additional reasoning tasks), with dynamic sampling and mixed batches to reinforce fundamentals.
5. **RLHF Fine-Tuning:** Refine the model using PPO, leveraging a nuanced reward function to encourage correct reasoning and answer generation.
6. **Evaluation & Checkpointing:** Regular evaluations and checkpoint saves ensure you can monitor performance and adjust training as needed.

This workflow leverages a structured warm-up, progressive curriculum, and reinforcement fine-tuning to build a robust reasoning model that generalizes well and produces accurate, step-by-step reasoning.
