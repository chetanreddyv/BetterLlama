learnings: Llama 3B 8bit quantized is better than Llama 1B full precision.

Initially i fine tuned llama 1B model to give it the ability to think (step by step reasoning before answer),
after a lot of testing I can see that model is not capturing complex pattern and is only good for basic tasks.

### **1. Model Size & Memory Efficiency**
- **Quantized 3B**: Even with 3× more parameters, quantization (e.g., 8-bit) reduces memory usage significantly. For example:
  - A 1B full-precision (32-bit) model requires **~4GB** (1B × 4 bytes).
  - A 3B quantized (8-bit) model requires **~3GB** (3B × 1 byte), making it **25% smaller** than the 1B model.
- **Winner**: Quantized 3B for memory efficiency.

### **2. Inference Speed**
- **Quantized 3B**: Lower precision (e.g., 8-bit) allows faster computations on hardware optimized for integer operations (e.g., GPUs/TPUs). Despite having more parameters, quantization often accelerates inference.
- **Full-Precision 1B**: Higher precision (32-bit) may slow down inference, especially on resource-constrained devices.
- **Winner**: Quantized 3B for speed (if hardware supports it).

### **3. Accuracy**
- **Full-Precision 1B**: No quantization loss, but smaller capacity limits its ability to capture complex patterns.
- **Quantized 3B**: Larger architecture may retain better task performance even after quantization, as the parameter count often compensates for precision loss (e.g., GPT-3 175B quantized to 4-bit still outperforms smaller full-precision models).
- **Caveat**: Aggressive quantization (e.g., 4-bit) can degrade accuracy, but 8-bit quantization typically preserves ~99% of accuracy in practice.
- **Winner**: Quantized 3B *if* quantization is well-implemented (e.g., via quantization-aware training).

---

### **4. Use Case & Hardware**
- **Edge/Mobile Deployment**: Quantized 3B is better due to smaller size and faster inference.
- **High-Accuracy Demands**: Test both models, but lean toward quantized 3B if it outperforms 1B in benchmarks.
- **Hardware Support**: If deploying on TPUs/GPUs with 8-bit optimization, quantized 3B is ideal.

### **Recommendation**
- **Choose the quantized 3B model** if:
  - Memory and latency are critical (e.g., mobile apps).
  - The quantization method is robust (e.g., 8-bit with minimal loss).
  - The task benefits from larger model capacity (e.g., complex NLP tasks).
- **Choose the full-precision 1B model** if:
  - Quantization causes significant accuracy drops (verify via testing).
  - Your hardware lacks support for low-precision inference.
  - The task is simple and doesn’t require a large model.

### **Practical Step**
- **Test Both**: Benchmark accuracy, latency, and memory usage on your specific task and hardware. For example, a quantized 3B model often matches or exceeds smaller full-precision models in real-world tasks (e.g., [Q8BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06188) shows <1% accuracy drop after 8-bit quantization).
